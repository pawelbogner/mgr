\chapter{Introduction}
The motion planning is an important part of robot control. Usually this is the first step
in robot control. 

The layout of this paper is as follows. Chapter \ref{ch:model} presents the models of researched
object: the unicycle and RobRex mobile manipulator. Chapter \ref{ch:endogen} introduces the endogenous
configuration space approach to motion planning problem. In chapter \ref{ch:simul}, there are collected
the results of the simulations of the objects mentioned above with application of the motion
planning algorithm. Chapter \ref{ch:concl} summarizes the whole research made.
